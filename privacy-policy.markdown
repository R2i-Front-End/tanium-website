## Information Collected By Tanium

Personal Information: In some cases, we collect information that you may choose to provide to us and in other cases we may collect personal information automatically. In other cases, we may collect information about you under the authority and direction of our customers, who are corporate entities.

Information collected through our website: Certain parts of our website may ask you to provide personal information voluntarily: for example, we may ask you to provide your contact details (such as your name, email address and phone number) if you request a demo or whitepaper from us, or if you otherwise contact us by e-mail using a contact form on the website. To access certain features of the websites, we collect login credentials and passwords in order to verify user authorization to access such features.

Information collected when you communicate with us (by mail, fax, or other means): We collect the personal information contained within, and associated with, your correspondence with us.

Information collected from our customers: We collect personal information about you as a representative of our customers, who are corporate entities, including customer relationship management data such as your name, job title, company name, address, phone number, email address or username and password in the course of providing you with the requested services. While we do not collect personal information as part of our customers’ general use of our products and services, we may acquire personal information in limited situations when our customers send their data to us, such as for technical support requests or for product improvement purposes.

Job applicants: We may also collect your contact details (such as your name, phone number, email address and address) and employment details if you send us a CV, resume or other details of your employment history in connection with an advertised Tanium job vacancy or a general enquiry regarding employment opportunities with us.

### Information that we collect automatically

When you visit our website, we may collect certain information automatically from your device. In some countries, including countries in the European Economic Area, this information may be considered personal information under applicable data protection laws.

Specifically, the information we collect automatically may include information like your IP address, device type, unique device identification numbers, browser-type, broad geographic location (e.g. country or city-level location) and other technical information. We may also collect information about how your device has interacted with our website, including the pages accessed and links clicked.

### Information that we obtain from third party sources

From time to time, we may receive personal information about you from third party sources (including content syndication vendors, data aggregators, and advertisers), but only where we have checked that these third parties either have your consent or are otherwise legally permitted or required to disclose your personal information to us.

The types of information we collect from third parties include name, company, role, location, and topics of interest, and we use the information we receive from these third parties to maintain and improve the accuracy of the records we hold about you and to communicate with you about any relevant products or services.

## How Collected Information is Used

The information that Tanium collects automatically through cookies and other similar technologies is used for analytics purposes, marketing and sales efforts to better target advertisements and other content in an effort to create a more personally relevant experience. The information is also used to predict responses to advertisements, and to help determine which advertisements perform best and which content is most appropriate for different individuals.

The personal information that you voluntarily provide to us or is otherwise provided to us by our customers may be used to provide you with the requested services, to manage your account and to respond to your enquiries, to provide support to our customers, and to improve and develop our products and services. Your information may also be used for marketing purposes. This use may result in follow-up communications from Tanium, in accordance with your communications preferences. In addition, as discussed in the section above, that information may be combined with information collected from other sources to assist with targeting advertisements to your preferences and behaviors, and for other Tanium sales and marketing efforts.

For information on how to opt-out and unsubscribe from our marketing communications, please read the “Your Choice And Rights” section below.

The personal information that you are asked to provide, and the reasons why you are asked to provide it, will be made clear to you at the point we ask you to provide your personal information.

## Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information (EEA Visitors Only)

If you are a visitor from the European Economic Area or the UK, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.

However, we will normally collect personal information from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.

If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).

Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.

If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “CONTACTING US” heading below.

## Sharing Information With Third Parties

We may disclose your personal information to the following categories of recipients:

to our group companies, third party services providers and partners who perform certain functions on our behalf and who provide services to us (for example, to fulfil requests for information, to receive and send communications, to update marketing lists, to analyze data, to provide IT and other support services or other similar tasks) or who otherwise process personal information for purposes that are described in this Privacy Policy or notified to you when we collect your personal information. Types of companies who may provide such services include IT suppliers, service providers, and other professional advisors;

to any competent law enforcement body, regulatory, government agency, court or other third party where we believe disclosure is necessary (i) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, (ii) to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights, or (iii) to protect your vital interests or those of any other person;

to a potential buyer (and its agents and advisers) in connection with any proposed purchase, merger or acquisition of any part of our business, provided that we inform the buyer it must use your personal information only for the purposes disclosed in this privacy policy;

to any other person with your consent to the disclosure.

## Our Privacy Policy and Outside Links

This Privacy Policy only applies to Tanium’s activities. Any information you submit to any third-party web sites is not in our control or governed by this Privacy Policy. You should be sure that you review the privacy policy of any site to which you link or redirect your browser and should not assume that any such web site is operated by Tanium or governed by this Privacy Policy.

## Security

Wherever your personal information may be held within Tanium or on its behalf, we intend to take appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the information you shared with us from access or disclosure not in compliance with this Policy. Please note that while Tanium will make reasonable efforts to protect your information, no transmission of data over the Internet is 100% secure.

## Your Choice and Rights

### You have the following data protection choice and rights:

If you wish to access, correct, update or request deletion of your personal information, you can do so at any time by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “Contacting Us” heading below and by providing us with the name of the service for which information was provided, your full name, mailing address, phone number and email address so that we may identify you.

In addition, if you are a resident of the European Economic Area or the UK, you can object to processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict processing of your personal information or request portability of your personal information. You can exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “Contacting Us” heading below.

You have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time. If you no longer wish to receive our newsletters, surveys or promotional communications via email, you may opt-out by clicking here and following the instructions to unsubscribe. You can also exercise this right by clicking on the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link in the marketing e-mails we send you or by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “Contacting Us” heading below. Please be aware that even after you opt-out from receiving our newsletters, surveys or promotional communications, you will continue to receive administrative messages from us, for example, in relation to a demo or other services you have requested from us.

Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority. (Contact details for data protection authorities in the European Economic Area, Switzerland and certain non-European countries (including the US and Canada) are available here.)

We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

## Children's Policy

In compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and similar laws applicable to websites directed at people under 16 years of age, www.tanium.com is not structured to attract children. Accordingly, we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 16 years of age. The web site and its content are directed to people who are at least 16 years of age or older. If you are under the age of 16, you may not use this web site unless you have the consent of, and are supervised by, a parent or guardian.

## Cross-Border Transfers

Your personal information may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers.

Specifically, our website servers are located in the United States, and our group companies and third party service providers and partners operate around the world, including in the United States. This means that when we collect your personal information we may process it in any of these countries.

However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy. These include complying with the Privacy Shield Framework for transfers of personal data from the EEA, UK and Switzerland to the US (see below). We also implement adequate safeguards such as the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses and the Privacy Shield onward transfer clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies.

If you would like to learn more about how we comply with data export rules or see our Standard Contractual Clauses, please contact us using the contact details below.

## Privacy Shield

Tanium, Inc. has certified its compliance with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks as set forth by the US Department of Commerce with respect to personal information concerning individuals from the EEA, UK and Switzerland. Please see our Privacy Shield Notice to learn more.

If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Notice and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.

## Data Retention

We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to fulfil your orders or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. Our data retention policy can be provided on request.

## Updates to this Policy

We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we do, we will also revise the “last updated” date at the beginning of the Privacy Policy. The then-current Privacy Policy will apply to all use of information by Tanium after the effective date. If we make any material changes in the way we treat personal information, we will notify you by including a notice in an email sent to the primary email address in your Tanium account or by placing a prominent notice on our Privacy Policy web pages and our home page. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about how we collect, use, and disclose personal information.
