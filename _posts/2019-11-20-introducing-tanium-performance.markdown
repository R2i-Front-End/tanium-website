Introducing Tanium Performance: Improved End User Experience on Endpoints! 
Performance issues are tough to identify and slow to fix. IT teams typically react only to the problems that end users remember to notify them about, and when they do react, they have difficulty measuring the effects of software and hardware changes on performance. IT Help Desks also resort to manual troubleshooting methods that fail to identify the root cause. All of this negatively impacts IT efficiency, worker productivity, and business continuity.

We are excited to announce the launch of Tanium Performance, which solves these problems by allowing organizations to monitor, investigate, and remediate endpoint performance issues, quickly and at scale. Tanium Performance is yet another extension of Taniumâ€™s platform for complete endpoint visibility and control.

## In this webinar, our product team will walk you through:

* An overview of Tanium Performance
* A live product demo
* Q & A discussion
