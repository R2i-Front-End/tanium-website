Global data privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA are becoming more prevalent, stringent and punitive. But in the rush to comply, many organizations lack the full endpoint visibility and control that is needed to ease compliance challenges, and will spend unnecessarily on too much software, in hopes that the next purchase will be the “silver bullet” to compliance.

In this 45-minute webinar from Tanium and guest Speaker Ryan O’Leary from IDC, you’ll learn:

* What it means to have full visibility and control over endpoints and why it has to be the new normal for governance, risk and compliance
* How to strengthen your risk and compliance posture by performing a gap analysis on your current environment
* How to avoid unnecessary compliance spending by defining what your security and IT systems management solutions must provide to keep pace with GDPR, CCPA and other privacy regulations
