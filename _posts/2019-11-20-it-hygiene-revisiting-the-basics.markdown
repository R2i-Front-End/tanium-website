    bio text: 'Chris Hallenbeck is CISO for the Americas at Tanium. Chris provides
      security leadership and operational insight gained from over 20 years in both
      public and private sector. Chris came to Tanium after almost 7 years of government
      service at the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT). At US-CERT
      he designed and built their incident response capabilities, and restructured
      the team''s focus toward strategic remediation with a goal of building more
      resilient organizations. Over countless IR engagements both with government
      and private sector victims a common theme emerged: a lack of emphasis on IT
      security hygiene. Prior to joining US-CERT, Chris worked for RSA Security/EMC
      as a security engineer and with AOL/Time Warner on their global incident response
      team. He started his career as a Unix sys-admin at Binghamton University. When
      not chasing electrons he prefers to be 20-30 meters under the sea.'

Over time, organizations have adapted to growing IT complexity with investments in best-of-breed tools, teams, and processes. However, this approach has only added complexity and made environments even harder to operate and secure. Operating today's environments requires revisiting the basics of security and systems management with a focus on simplification.

Join as Chris Hallenbeck discusses the importance of taking a continuous approach to IT Hygiene. He’ll share how revisiting the basics of security and systems management can accelerate cross-functional processes, improve organizational security, and harmonize IT Ops and Security teams.
 
## In this 45-minute webinar, you’ll learn:

* How to take an end-to-end approach to IT Hygiene that spans processes, tools, and departments.
* How to drive alignment and collaboration between IT Ops and Security.
* How Tanium delivers IT Hygiene with our proven platform for endpoint visibility and control
